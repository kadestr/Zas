# Pull Requests

A pull request (PR) is a method of submitting contributions to a software project. It allows developers to notify team members that they have completed a feature or bug fix and are ready for it to be reviewed and potentially merged into the main codebase. Pull requests facilitate collaboration by enabling code reviews, discussions, and feedback before changes are integrated.
